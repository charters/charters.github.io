            A mobile app for displaying what dining halls are open at UVA.
          </p>

          <p>
            "What dining halls are open?" - you'd think it'd be an easy question to answer. Unfortunately,
            UVA's dining hall information,including their hours, is scattered throughout a web of individual dining hall pages.
            There is a .PDF students can reference, but it lists all the dining hall hours, and you'd have to go through one-by-one.
          </p>

          <p>
            Using Node.js and Cheerio, an HTML-scraping library, I scraped dining hall hours from their individual pages and populated a personal database with the hours.
            Built on <a href="http://scaphold.io">Scaphold</a>, a GraphQL back-end as a service platform, I built a ReactJS based front-end optimized for mobile. Simple and functional.

            Built more for me to learn, than to fill a need, Moodboard is a front-end web app built with React + Redux app, backed by another GraphQL backend provided by <a href="http://scaphold.io">Scaphold</a>.

            For having no musical talent myself, I have a disproportionate interest in music. I'm constantly

            After a Documentary Film class in college, I can't be stopped. I've watched just about every food or health documentary
            on Netflix. Working my way through their whole library of docs.

            Hopefully you can find me on Github, since you've already found my github page. I try to commit a few times a week to stay sharp.

            Like I mentioned in my hobbies, I'm a bit of a music hoarder. I've got about 30 playlists filled with all different types of music.
            I recommend checking out my curated playlist for some of my alternative, indie, and folk favorites. Jazzhop is a great playlist choice if
            you are looking for something new.
